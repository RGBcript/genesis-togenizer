# Togen Similarity Validation Log
Date: 2025-12-30
Version: v1.1 (LSH SimHash + Metaphone)

## Methodology
We compare the Hamming Distance (number of differing bits) between the Togens of various word pairs.
- **Semántico (32-bit):** Uses LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) on trigrams. Lower distance = Structural/Spelling similarity.
- **Estructural (32-bit):** Uses Metaphone. Lower distance = Phonetic similarity.

## Results

| Pair | Semantic Dist (Bits) | Phonetic Dist (Bits) | Interpretation |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `genesis` vs `genesys` | **0** | 5 | **Identical Semantics**. The system correctly identifies them as the same concept despite the typo. |
| `hello` vs `hallo` | **4** | - | **High Similarity**. Correctly groups dialectal variations. |
| `hello` vs `hola` | **7** | - | **Low Similarity**. Correctly distinguishes different languages. |
| `genesis` vs `skynet` | **6** | 12 | **Distinct**. No confusion between unrelated concepts. |
| `night` vs `knight` | - | **13** | *Note: Metaphone implementation needs tuning for silent letters.* |

## Conclusion
The LSH implementation successfully clusters structurally similar words (typos, variations) into the same semantic neighborhood (Hamming Distance < 5).
